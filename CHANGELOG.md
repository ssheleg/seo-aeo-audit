# Changelog

## v0.1.0

First release.

- `seo-aeo-audit` skill: ten evidence-based audit tracks (A access & indexation
  economics, B canonicalization, C architecture & link equity, D intent & SERP
  fit, E content value, F extractability/AEO-GEO, G entity & brand consensus,
  H experience signals, I risk & threats, J measurement), a triage model
  (`priority = (impact × confidence) / effort` with evidence-tier weights), and a
  two-file deliverable contract (findings report + change plan).
- Thirteen reference files inside the skill directory, so every distribution
  channel ships the contracts: technical checks, architecture & equity, intent &
  content, AEO/GEO mechanics, entity & brand, experience signals, threats &
  defence, measurement, the ranked play list, experiment design, evidence tiers,
  the myth guard, and dated 2026 benchmarks.
- `scripts/page_audit.py` — stdlib-only page auditor: indexing directives, the
  canonical extra-attribute trap, heading/schema inventory, image alt coverage,
  JS-gated price detection, and an answer-engine **read-budget** estimate
  (~5,700-character first read, link markers versus content). Works offline via
  `--file`.
- `/seo-aeo-audit` slash command, Cursor rule with the contracts embedded inline,
  audit-report and action-plan templates.
- Structural validator (`test/validate.py`) with four-way version sync, reference
  and script checks, and a functional test suite for the auditor
  (`test/test_page_audit.py`) running against two offline fixtures.
- Distribution: Claude Code plugin, vercel skills CLI, npx installer, Cursor,
  POSIX `install.sh`.
